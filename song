 I can buy myself flowers
 write my name in the sand
 talk to me for hours
 Say things you don't understand
 I can take myself dancing
 And I can hold my own hand
 Yeah, I can love me better than you can
 talk to me boooooy
 everyday working
					 
 
 I know that dress is karma
 perfume regret
 you got me thinking about when you were mine
 And I am all upon you, what you expect?
